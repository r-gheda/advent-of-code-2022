# Advent of Code 2022
![](https://blogs.sap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EkaoQQTXEAMA4BN.jpg)
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You can find more about it on the [official website](https://adventofcode.com/).

# What is this repo about?
I didn't participate in the AoC challenge competitively this year but I exploited its puzzles to learn the Rust language.
